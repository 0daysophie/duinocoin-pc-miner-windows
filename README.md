# duinocoin-pc-miner-windows
This is just the official Duco miner but repacked to make the libducohasher library work again

To compile the miner, make sure that Python is installed and run `compile.cmd`. The script should automatically pull the latest PC miner from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duino-coin/duino-coin/refs/heads/master/PC_Miner.py and all the needed dependencies. The icon is included and must be downloaded with the script in this repo.
